**Note**:In addition to topic output interface,there are three other output interfaces.
### Service
- Object Detection Service:
```/detect_object``` ([object_msgs::srv::DetectObject](https://github.com/intel/ros2_object_msgs/blob/master/srv/DetectObject.srv))
- Face Detection Service:
```/detect_face``` ([object_msgs::srv::DetectObject](https://github.com/intel/ros2_object_msgs/blob/master/srv/DetectObject.srv))
- Age & Gender Detection Service:
```/detect_age_gender``` ([people_msgs::srv::AgeGender](https://github.com/intel/ros2_openvino_toolkit/blob/devel/people_msgs/srv/AgeGender.srv))
- Headpose Detection Service:
```/detect_head_pose``` ([people_msgs::srv::HeadPose](https://github.com/intel/ros2_openvino_toolkit/blob/devel/people_msgs/srv/HeadPose.srv))
- Emotion Detection Service:
```/detect_emotion``` ([people_msgs::srv::Emotion](https://github.com/intel/ros2_openvino_toolkit/blob/devel/people_msgs/srv/Emotion.srv))

### RViz
RViz dispaly is also supported by the composited topic of original image frame with inference result.
To show in RViz tool, add an image marker with the composited topic:
```/ros2_openvino_toolkit/image_rviz```([sensor_msgs::msg::Image](https://github.com/ros2/common_interfaces/blob/master/sensor_msgs/msg/Image.msg))

### Image Window
OpenCV based image window is natively supported by the package.
To enable window, Image Window output should be added into the output choices in .yaml config file. see [the config file guidance](https://github.com/intel/ros2_openvino_toolkit/blob/devel/doc/YAML_CONFIGURATION_GUIDE.md) for checking/adding this feature in your launching.
